# Abraham-et-al-code

Exponentialfit_Abraham_et_al fits a single exponential function of the form  y=-a*(exp(b*x)-c), separately on decay and recovery phases of Off response (and similarly recovery and decay of On response) of the averaged light response curve to find the best fit exponential curve and estimate response amplitude and speed, Tau.
